# Livewire Course - Learning Journey

Hi Future Developer,

Welcome to **Livewire Course**! This project is a dedicated space for learning [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) from scratch. While I have experience with [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/) PHP and have built several projects using it, I realized that a deep understanding of [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) is essential for creating custom components and advanced interactions in [Filament](https://filamentphp.com/). This project serves as my hands-on learning path to master the fundamentals and advanced concepts of [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/).

## Dazzling Tech Stack

- [Laravel 12](https://laravel.com/) - Backend PHP Framework
- [Livewire 3](https://livewire.laravel.com/) - Full-stack framework for Laravel
- [PHP 8.3+](https://www.php.net/) - Server-side language
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Database Management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

## Demo Version
Coming soon.
